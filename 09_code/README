Visualforce Cookbook Second Edition Chapter 9 Code Download

The code samples can be added to your Salesforce instance in one of two ways:

Cut and Paste
Simply paste the body of the file into the online code editor, as detailed in the 
recipe instructions.

Force.com IDE
If you are using the Force.com IDE (Eclipse Plugin) you can install all of the pages
and classes in one go.
Copy the files from the pages and classes folders to the respective pages and 
classes folder under the src folder of your Salesforce project.
Right click the src folder of your Salesforce project and select Refresh from the
context menu. This will update the server with the newly added files.

Note that for recipe 3, Capturing the user's location, you need to create the
required custom field on the lead object before you will be able to save the code
via the IDE
